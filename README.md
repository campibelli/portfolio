## How and WhyðŸ“š
Done using Angular 18, latest npm/node packages, some nice typescript and of course html/css.
As a Backend focused dev, it's important to study other technologies and learn how things work.

Concepts studied: Html sanitization, DOM handling, html/css in overall, typescript, angular utilities like translation, folder structures, project normalization and deployment best practices.
